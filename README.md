Ark Survivor Journal! 

This is my personal project during my studies at Dev Academy. For my first solo attempt at using a RESTful API I wanted to create an online journal that a user could log into and track their progress when playing Ark Survival Evolved. I initially wanted to encorporate an API to track the data the player was accumulating in game and store it so the player could see their resources and tames directly. Currently, players must input the data manually as I have not found an API that delivers the necessary data.

This is an ongoing project, and the road map for the completion of this project has grown larger and larger. I will be focusing on moving the project to a Create React App framework in order to lessen any potential security issues. Currently, my learning journey is focusing on testing, and I plan on adding tests in order to make my code more robust.
