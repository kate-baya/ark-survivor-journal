Ark Survivor Journal! This is my personal project during my studies at Dev Academy. I wanted to create an online journal that a user could log into and track their progress when playing Ark Survival Evolved. I initially wanted to encorporate an API to track the data the player was accumulating in game and store it so the player could see their resources and tames directly. Currently, players must input the data manually.
